👋 Hi, I'm Srdjan Popovic

Senior Backend Developer | Geoinformatics Specialist | EO/AI Explorer 

🛰️ About Me

I'm a Python backend developer with a deep curiosity for geospatial data, remote sensing, and environmental monitoring. With a strong academic and applied background, I work on scalable backend systems, spatiotemporal data processing, and Earth Observation platforms. I also enjoy making complex things more accessible—whether it's through open-source, clean API design, or teaching.

Currently working in a startup at the crossroads of web GIS, machine learning, and satellite data.
